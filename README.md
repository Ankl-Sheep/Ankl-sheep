-- DNI LIST --
if your going to be rude, immature, or toxic towards me or my friends, i rather just stay away from you and not interact with you at all.

if ur homophobic, racist, or anything like that.

DO NOT try and flirt with me if ur a complete stranger to me and do not have any sort of bond with me, i have my boundaries for that.

you support/are a M@p, Pr0sh1pp3r, D3rksh1pp3r, ANY of that stuff, its disgusting and along with u so called "trollers" trolling as that isn't FUNNY or cool, it just makes you problematic and stright up WEIRD.

if try to or are forcing religious beliefs on others

lowk deadass if you like or support Tcoaal, ur disgusting and should stay FAR away from me, i will block and hide u permanently. if u think i'll ever unblock you i will be adding a "do not unblock" note on your pony.

anything else thats normally on a dni list is something u should already know so i dont have to write so much
